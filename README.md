# Day Planner 

The point of this was to created a day planner, where you can see a full work day, 9AM-5PM.  The planner allows you to schedule and save appointments, meetings etc. throughout the day.  As the day progresses, the rows will change color depenging on if it's past, present or future hours.  The save button allows you to save the data, and will stay there upon reload.  I also added a reset button that when pressed, clears all data and allows the user to start from new.
